    This is a test to see if Github pages will automatically serve index.html pages without explicitly being declared in
    the request URL.
  </p>
  <p>
    It does work.  You can go to <a href="https://dhurlburtusa.github.io/background/">https://dhurlburtusa.github.io/background/</a>
    and it will be as if you requested https://dhurlburtusa.github.io/background/index.html instead.  This will help keep
    the URLs "clean".
